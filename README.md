# hearthstone-tracker
An electron based Hearthstone tracker

To get started:

`git clone git@github.com:gregstewart/hearthstone-tracker.git && cd hearthstone-tracker`

Then run:

`npm i && npm start`

After a shortish time you should see something like the below the firs time you start the app:

![First screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregstewart/hearthstone-tracker/master/assets/screenshot.png)

Launch `Hearthstone` and play a few games, the UI *should* update after each completed game.

If you see an error similar to the below:

```
> hearthstone-tracker@0.4.0 start /Users/gregstewart/Projects/GitHub/hearthstone-tracker
> electron .

info: undefined undefined
error:  Error: Module version mismatch. Expected 50, got 48. This generally implies that leveldown was built with a different version of node than that which is running now.  You may try fully removing and reinstalling PouchDB or leveldown to resolve.
```

Then run:

`npm run rebuild:leveldb && npm start`

To run the tests:

`npm test`
